# ConnectFour-ComputerVisionAI
A computer vision project to detect the presence of the board game "ConnectFour" ("Four-In-A-Row") from an image, and identify the next player's optimal move. The image is processed with the Python implementation of CV2 and we perform Bilateral Filtering, Edge Detection,  Contour Analysis and HSV Filtering to identify the current game state. Next, we apply the MiniMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move for the next player to make!
